    "Examine the `invalid_zip_bus` dataframe we computed above and look at the businesses that DO NOT have the special MISSING ZIP code value.  Some of the invalid postal codes are just the full 9 digit code rather than the first 5 digits.  Create a new column named `postal5` in the original `bus` dataframe which contains only the first 5 digits of the `postal_code` column.   Finally, for any of the `postal5` ZIP code entries that were not a valid San Fransisco ZIP Code (according to `valid_zips`) set the entry to `None`.  \n",

There seem to be a few gaps in between some bins, especially between the 90-100 bins, which suggests that there are missing values in the inspection scores. What is also interesting is that most scores are above 65, which may be due to multiple reasons: maybe the inspectors are scoring too highly, or most restaurants registered in San Francisco are decent with their health inspection qualities, or most restaurants who have very low inspection scores were shut down, such that they are not included in the dataset anymore."

    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",

I don't necessarily expect the spread or standard deviation to change noticeably. However, I am observing that the output histogram is a bell-curve centered around a mean of 0, indicating that the average score change is 0 such that the scores do not necessarily show a tend of improving between the two inspections.
