UC Berkeley Data 100: Principles and Techniques of Data Science

In this project, I explore various data regarding the restaurants located in San Francisco as well as their Food Safety inspection scores in an attempt to better understand the data and perform relevant analysis. 

Tools such as Python Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn were used for data processing and visualization. Enjoy!
